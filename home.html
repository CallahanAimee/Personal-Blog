                <h3>Do parental couples forgive infidelity more easily? The moderating role of the attachment style.</h3>
                <p>The present research aims to investigate the willingness to forgive the partner's infidelity in couples with children. The hypothesis is based on evolutionary theories and states that a parent will more easily forgive the partner's infidelity in order to preserve and maximize the resources needed to raise the child. This study has a non-experimental cross-sectional design with the following variables: parental status as an independent variable, forgiveness of infidelity as a dependent variable, and attachment style as a moderating variable. The sampling technique used is of the type of convenience group obtained by the snowball technique, the sample of this study consisting of 343 participants (300 women and 43 men). The results showed that although intuition tells us that a parent would indeed forgive such an event more easily, in reality this is not exactly true.</p>

                <h3>The dark triad and jealousy in couple's relationship. The moderating role of the attachment style.</h3>
                <p>The present study aims to investigate the relationship between the three features of the dark triad and jealousy in romantic relationships. The hypothesis of this research assumes a statistically significant positive relationship between at least one facet of the dark triad (Machiavellism, psychopathy and narcissism) and romantic jealousy, but also a possible moderating effect of the attachment style on this relationship. This study has a non-experimental cross-sectional design with the following variables: dark triad as an independent variable, romantic jealously as a dependent variable, and attachment style as a moderating variable. </p>

                <h3>The relationship between smoking and risk-taking. The moderating role of stress resistance.</h3>
                <p>Smoking is one of the most common forms of substance abuse. Tobacco smoking is by far the most common way to smoke, being used by over a billion people in most human societies. According to the latest statistics, smoking in Romania kills 33,000 people a year. Over 70% of them die between the ages of 35 and 69. Although the harmful effects of smoking are well known, people continue to smoke. This study aimed to investigate whether smokers really have a higher level of risk-taking and whether it is influenced by stress resistance. For the research, a group of 54 people with an average age of 34.09 (SD = 12.98) was used, and 85.2% of the participants are female. Of these, 48.1 (n = 26) consume tobacco, and 16.7 (n = 9) consume only occasionally. Following statistical analyzes, no statistically significant relationship was found between tobacco use and risk-taking, nor in terms of stress resistance.</p>
